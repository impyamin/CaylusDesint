        Following the passing order, the players may offer batches to the castle (if they want to). A batch is composed of 3 resources: 1 food, 1 wood and 1 stone. Each player gives the stock their cubes accordingly and takes as many point tokens as they have given batches.
        Prestige point tokens are taken according to a certain order: first those of the Dungeon (red tokens), then those of the Walls (orange tokens) and finally those of the Towers (yellow tokens). A player may earn tokens of different colors in the same turn.
        A player cannot offer more batches than there are prestige point tokens left in the stock. So, it is possible for a player to have some batches left.
        The player who has offered the most batches during this phase takes 1 gold cube from the stock.
        In case of a draw, the player who offered that number of batches first wins the cube.
        If no-one has offered any batch during this phase, 2 tokens are removed from the stock of victory points - these tokens are removed from the game. As was the case for building, these tokens are taken from the proper section of the Castle (red, then orange, then yellow).
        If no token is left in the stock, the game is over.
